Activating Office 2019 using KMS license key
Method 1: Running commands one by one manually

Step 1.1: Open command prompt in administrator mode.
First, you need to open command prompt with admin rights, then follow the instruction below step by step. Just copy/paste the commands and do not forget to hit Enter in order to execute them.

Step 1.2: Open location of the Office installed on your PC.

cd /d %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office16
cd /d %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office16

If you install your Office in the ProgramFiles folder, the path will be “%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office16” or “%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office16”. It depends on the architecture of the Windows OS you are using. If you are not sure of this issue, don’t worry, just run both of the commands above. One of them will be not executed and an error message will be printed on the screen.



Step 1.3: Convert your retail license to volume one.


for /f %x in ('dir /b ..\root\Licenses16\ProPlus2019VL*.xrm-ms') do cscript ospp.vbs /inslic:"..\root\Licenses16\%x"


If your Office is got from Microsoft, this step is required. On the contrary, if you install Office from a Volume ISO file, this is optional so just skip it if you want.

Step 1.4: Activate your Office using KMS client key.
Make sure your PC is connected to the internet, then run the following command.

cscript ospp.vbs /setprt:1688
cscript ospp.vbs /unpkey:6MWKP >nul
cscript ospp.vbs /inpkey:NMMKJ-6RK4F-KMJVX-8D9MJ-6MWKP
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:107.175.77.7
cscript ospp.vbs /act



All Done
